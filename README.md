# sign-in-backend
This is the backend portion of my final year project, a system for taking attendance at lectures.
It is a REST API written in JavaScript using Node.js.
It uses MongoDB for the database with the Mongoose library.

## To run:
Make sure you have a MongoDB database running locally, start it with:
```
mongod
```
Once that is running:
```
npm install
npm start
```

and the backend will start runnning on http://localhost:3000
